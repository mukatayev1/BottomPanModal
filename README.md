# BottomPanModal Package

## Welcome to the SPM Dependency Package

This repository contains a package dependency for the SPM package. The package was originally based on the [PanModal package](https://github.com/slackhq/PanModal), which is no longer being maintained. In order to continue to use and update the package, the repo has been copied, updated, and transferred it to the SPM package.

As the maintainer of this package, I will continue to make any necessary updates and modifications to ensure that it remains functional for use with SPM. If you have any issues or suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for using this package, and we hope it will be helpful for your project!
